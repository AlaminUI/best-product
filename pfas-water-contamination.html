                  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -- has become a growing concern for drinking water safety in
                  thousands of American communities, as scientists increasingly see links to liver damage, high
                  cholesterol, weakened immune systems and cancer.</p>

                  firefighting foams, a top source of PFAS contamination.</p>

                <p>"They're very dangerous and they're migrating very slowly," Guo said of the heat-resistant chemicals.

                    of the chemicals in water systems nationwide in recent years has begun to alarm state and local
                    leaders and prompted Congress to consider urgent action.</p>
                  <p>Last month, the city of Tucson, Arizona, abruptly shut down a major water treatment facility that
                    delivered drinking water to 60,000 residents because of a sudden surge in PFAS contamination that
                    threatened to overwhelm groundwater filtration systems.</p>

                  <p>"We don't have enough confidence to go to drinking water supply at this time," said John Kmiec,
                    interim director of Tucson Water. "We know that there's this contamination out there. We don't know
                    exactly what it does, but we know it's not going away."</p>
                  <p>Some level of PFAS, widely known as "forever chemicals" because they do not break down in the
                    environment, have been found in water samples of 2,790 communities across 49 states, according to an
                    analysis by the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/"  target="_blank">Environmental Working Group</a> (EWG), an
                    independent research and consumer watchdog organization pushing to limit exposure to chemicals
                    through water, food and household products.</p>

                      </p>

                  <p>The contamination is likely much more widespread, experts said, because the EPA does not require
                    testing for the chemicals and has not set a mandatory limit for how much PFAS are safe to drink in
                    tap water.</p>
                  <p>"It's likely an issue in every community, and that's why we need testing to find out," said Sydney
                    Evans, an EWG water quality analyst who has conducted PFAS testing across the country.</p>

                    (ppt) may result in "adverse health effects." The agency encouraged utilities to voluntarily monitor
                    and filter to below that level, but does not enforce a standard.</p>

                  <p>President Joe Biden pledged during the 2020 campaign to accelerate the study and regulation of
                    PFAS, but his EPA has yet to designate the class of substances as hazardous under the Safe Drinking
                    Water Act.</p>
                  <p>There is growing momentum in Congress to pressure the agency over the issue. In a bipartisan vote
                    last month, the House <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2467/text"
                       target="_blank" >approved a

                    water within two years, requiring more water systems to start filtering the chemicals out. The
                    Senate's pending bipartisan infrastructure bill would include billions to help communities get the

                  <p>Many environmental and consumer advocates said the EPA's delay in regulating the chemicals more
                    broadly is highly troubling.</p>
                  <p>"I think that the EPA -- we need to hold their feet to the fire because nothing is going to change,
                    nothing will go forward until they set those limits," said Yolanda Herrera, a longtime Tucson
                    community advocate for safe drinking water. "It's going to take all of us together to go to
                    Congress, to go to the EPA to make major changes that need to be done."</p>
                  <p>Remediation of PFAS in water systems can be time-consuming and costly. The lack of an EPA-mandated
                    drinking water standard complicates the process, state and local officials told ABC News, because
                    there is not a clear benchmark for how much needs to be cleaned up and what resources governments
                    need to meet it.</p>
                  <p>"We have no way of removing PFAS from the body," said Dr. Philippe Grandjean, a top environmental
                    health expert and <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/philippe-grandjean/"
